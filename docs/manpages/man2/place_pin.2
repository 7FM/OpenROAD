place_pin - place pin
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
place_pin -pin_name pin_name -layer layer -location {x y} [-pin_size
{width height}] [-force_to_die_boundary]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]place_pin\f[R] command places a specific pin in the specified
location with the specified size.
It is recommended that individual pins be placed before the
\f[C]place_pins\f[R] command, as the routing tracks occupied by these
individual pins will be blocked, preventing overlaps.
.PP
To place an individual pin:
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\f[C]-hor_layers\f[R]: The layers to create the metal shapes of pins
placed in horizontal tracks.
It can be a single layer or a list of layer names.
.PP
\f[C]-ver_layers\f[R]: The layers to create the metal shapes of pins
placed in vertical tracks.
It can be a single layer or a list of layer names.
.PP
\f[C]-corner_avoidance\f[R]: The distance (in microns) from each corner
within which pin placement should be avoided.
.PP
\f[C]-min_distance\f[R]: The minimum distance between pins on the die
boundary.
This distance can be in microns (default) or in number of tracks between
each pin.
.PP
\f[C]-min_distance_in_tracks\f[R]: Flag that allows setting the min
distance in number of tracks instead of microns.
.PP
\f[C]-exclude\f[R]: A region where pins cannot be placed.
Either \f[C]top|bottom|left|right:edge_interval\f[R], which is the edge
interval from the selected edge; \f[C]begin:end\f[R] for begin-end of
all edges.
.PP
\f[C]-group_pins\f[R]: A list of pins to be placed together on the die
boundary.
.PP
\f[C]-annealing\f[R]: Flag to enable simulated annealing pin placement.
.PP
\f[C]-write_pin_placement\f[R]: A file with the pin placement generated
in the format of multiple calls for the \f[C]place_pin\f[R] command.
