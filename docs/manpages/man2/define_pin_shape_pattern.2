.SH NAME
.PP
define_pin_shape_pattern - define pin shape pattern
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
define_pin_shape_pattern -layer layer -x_step x_step -y_step y_step
-region {llx lly urx ury} -size {width height} [-pin_keepout dist]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]define_pin_shape_pattern\f[R] command defines a pin placement
grid on the specified layer.
This grid has positions inside the die area, not only at the edges of
the die boundary.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\f[C]-layer\f[R]: The single top-most routing layer of the placement
grid.
.PP
\f[C]-x_step, -y_step\f[R]: The distance (in microns) between each valid
position on the grid in the x- and y-directions, respectively.
.PP
\f[C]-region\f[R]: The \f[C]{llx, lly, urx, ury}\f[R] region of the
placement grid (in microns).
.PP
\f[C]-size\f[R]: The width and height (in microns) of the pins assigned
to this grid.
The centers of the pins are placed on the grid positions.
Pins may have half of their shapes outside the defined region.
.PP
\f[C]-pin_keepout\f[R]: The boundary (in microns) around existing
routing obstructions that the pins should avoid; this defaults to the
\f[C]layer\f[R] minimum spacing.
